        <p class="para">Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.</p>
        <p class="para">Think of all the web pages you have used over the years - Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on. A Website Developer have knowledge of a variety of programming languages, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS, PHP, and JavaScript but also extending to other languages (Ruby, C/C++, Python), frameworks, and libraries</p>
        <h2>Types of Web development</h2>
        <p class="para">There are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.</p>

    <section class="frontend_text">
        <p class="para">Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web development. That is to say usually, front-end web development refers to the portion of the site, app, or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks and “feels,” which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers.</p>
        <p class="para">Front-End Developers will usually need to possess a solid understanding of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS. Responsibilities of a Front-End Developer would include creating responsive websites (that look and function well on any device), conducting website testing and fixing any bugs detected along the web development process, and ensuring site structure follows SEO best practices.</p>

        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="backend_text">
        <p class="para"> Back-End Developers are focused on how a website works. A Back-End Developer creates the basic framework of a website before maintaining it and ensuring it performs the way it should, including database interactions, user authentication, server, network and hosting configuration, and business logic. Working behind the scenes - or server-side - Back End Developers are concerned with the systems and structures that allow computer applications to perform as desired.</p>
        <p class="para">Typically, Back-End Developers use server-side programming languages, including PHP, Ruby, and Python, as well as tools including MySQL, Oracle, and Git.</p>

            <span class="span">full-stack-developer</span>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="full_stack_text">
        <p class="para">A Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end development. Full Stack Developers usually understand a wide variety of programming languages and because of their versatility, they might be given more of a leadership role on projects than developers who specialize. They are generalists, adept at wearing both hats, and familiar with every layer of development. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers - according to an Indeed study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.</p>
        <p class="para">What's unclear is whether Developers are now expected to possess a broader skillset, or if Developers are taking it upon themselves to understand functions at both the front-end and back-end. Either way, it's becoming increasingly important for aspiring Developers to have a foundation in both. And with demand for Developers expected to grow 15 percent by 2026 (for 24,400 new jobs), much faster than the U.S. average rate of job growth, there may not be a better time to dive in and learn more about all the layers of Web Development.</p>

        <h2>UI Designer</h2>
        <p class="para">A UI Designer — or User Interface Designer — designs all the screens through which a user will move while using a website, app, or video game, while also creating the visual design elements that make this movement possible. In other words, UI Designers are responsible for creating what users see when they visit a website or product. UI design professionals are responsible for creating, designing, and organizing interactive elements, usually in close collaboration with UX Designers who will have mapped out a vision for the project.</p>
        <h2>UX Designer</h2>
        <p class="para">The term User Experience (UX) refers to all aspects of this interaction. Think about the last time you used a new product. Were you able to accomplish your task? How easy was it? How did it make you feel? UX design seeks to make products and services that are easy, effective, and delightful.</p>
        <p class="para">UX (user experience) design is the process of designing products and experiences that are efficient, effective, and even delightful for users.</p>
